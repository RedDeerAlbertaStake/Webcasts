Your mic should be set to **USB Audio CODEC** and your speaker should be set to **Headphone (Realtek(R) Audio)** (this may vary depending on the laptop).

If you wish to play sound from the laptop (music, etc) over the meeting, select the same speaker for your windows sound in the system tray.

Control the audio volume in the chapel for those speaking on Zoom by using the volume nob on the Crab Box.
